The following anonymised entries from the log book give a flavour of what went on in 2018.

I had a lovely chat with a Muslim couple - they joined in and said they had Jesus too!

Another long chat with an agnostic who took a Luke’s Gospel after I explained how reading it had helped me become a Christian.

Please pray for L recently widowed.

Prayer request for someone with pancreatic cancer and someone else with leukaemia.

D and D who are researching their faith. May come to Christ Church at 9:30am. Would be good for Alpha in Feb.

Talked to a few people and interesting conversations. As I was on my own couldn’t see everybody, but all was ok and happy.

Had a great conversation with E who said he was a sympathetic atheist. He said he was brought up as a Christian but he didn’t believe. He would like to but didn’t. We asked if we could pray for him. He wanted us to. He lives in Gosport and was invited to Stubbington church carol service. He was interested.

Our first time! Very few people in market due to cold. Given out at least 12 Luke’s Gospels and [various] leaflets. Photos of families @ crib. Had quite a few short conversations and enjoyed it. Very cold toes. Thought the stand was so good this year.

Found a return train ticket. Prayed I would find the person whose ticket it was. Headed into the crowd & came face to face with a lady who had written a prayer star earlier - the ticket was hers!

Brilliant stalls at which people constantly stopped, were photographed, given leaflet and a quick explanation of faith/Gospel.

Met a lady who used to be a Catholic and had a good chat about Jesus. Prayed for a man looking for a job.

Invited a young lady and man to  write on a star. They were thoughtful & wrote on them. I asked if they had a faith of their own. He said ‘vaguely’. I offered a Luke’s Gospel saying it had the story of Christmas. Asked them to read it & ask God to reveal himself. They said they would.

[A] long conversation with a retired police officer; answered useful questions from a group of 4 teenagers; prayed with a Christian worker who’s lost her glasses; decided not to suggest writing on stars - too wet & windy, but, mercifully, warm.

Very quiet, at least stopped raining for a bit. Friendly chats to stall holders. Went early as nothing happening.

A great day full of joy. Many conversations and lots of photographs taken - both in the Nativity and of the stars. People appreciated the Christian presence and the opportunity for a chat. Good conversations with people of different faiths, Christians and those who were exploring or curious. People were happy to talk about what Christmas means for them and happy to be prayed for. Several people took booklets and asked about local services. A lovely opportunity to witness to light and love and Jesus.

A steady stream of star-makers, without much conversation about Christmas or Jesus. All in good spirits.

No-one at 12:30 when we arrived to do out stint. We sang some carols. Many folk with problems. Lady on a stall we spoke to, has lung cancer so we prayer for her. Lots of people have mentioned that they would have loved to have seen the “real Nativity” with dressing up clothes like previous years! Something to reinstate!

What a delight to end the day - the Cathedral Junior Choir singing carols and the Blessing of the Nativity Chalet. The chalet traders joined in the singing along with passers by. Also the young child who was besotted with elves stayed and joined in with the short service.

Lunch time - couple of gospels given out.

Man from Dorset [...] with cancer - [prayed for] healing. C with cancer from Bournemouth - to be clear completely. J with cystic fibrosis - healing.
