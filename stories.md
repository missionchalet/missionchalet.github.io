The following anonymised entries from the log book give a flavour of what went on in 2018.

I had a lovely chat with a Muslim couple - they joined in and said they had Jesus too!

I met a lovely lady who wanted more peace of mind in her life.

One lady had lost her daughter this year and was happy to be prayed for.

A long discussion with an Anglo-Catholic gentleman.

Another long chat with an agnostic who took a Luke’s Gospel after I explained how reading it had helped me become a Christian.

Please pray for L recently widowed.

Prayer request for someone with pancreatic cancer and someone else with leukaemia.

D and D who are researching their faith. May come to Christ Church at 9:30am. Would be good for Alpha in Feb.

Lots of university students. About 56 stars.

Talked to a few people and interesting conversations. As I was on my own couldn’t see everybody, but all was ok and happy.

Had a great conversation with E who said he was a sympathetic atheist. He said he was brought up as a Christian but he didn’t believe. He would like to but didn’t. We asked if we could pray for him. He wanted us to. He lives in Gosport and was invited to Stubbington church carol service. He was interested.

Our first time! Very few people in market due to cold. Given out at least 12 Luke’s Gospels and [various ]leaflets. Photos of families @ crib. Had quite a few short conversations and enjoyed it. Very cold toes. Thought the stand was so good this year.

Please pray for R to make up with her Mum.

Please pray for S that his bone marrow treatment works.

Please pray for K, E and M (three separate). Leaflets out plus prayer points - a good session: PTL.

Lots of interested children. And photos.

Please pray for G.

Pray for L who is very poorly. Serious condition. Had 54 operations. & for her family.

A man said “I came last year (from Wigan) and wrote out a prayer. I came later on the early part of the following year and visited Vineyard Church -- and they read out my prayer! The one I had written! I was gobsmacked! Not only that, but my prayer was then answered when I got back to Wigan!”

Please pray that A’s baby will be granted life and health. Docs say less than 1% chance she will be born alive. Nevertheless, not our will but Yours. Thank you.

A lady walked away reading M’s words. [two ladies] (having a first baby when dad has gone). Numerous students. 3 lively babies & mums.

Happy Birthday Jesus ♥

Thank you for looking after [A] like I wrote last year! She’s in a good place now! Love C.

I wish for [C’s] IVF to go well so she can have a child.

Found a return train ticket. Prayed I would find the person whose ticket it was. Headed into the crowd & came face to face with a lady who had written a prayer start earlier - the ticket was hers!

Brilliant stalls at which people constantly stopped, were photographed, given leaflet and a quick explanation of faith/Gospel.

Met a lady who used to be a Catholic and had a good chat about Jesus. Prayed for a man looking for a job.

Invited a young lady and man to  write on a start. They were thoughtful & wrote on them. I asked if they had a faith of their own. He said ‘vaguely’. I offered a Luke’s Gospel saying it had the story of Christmas. Asked them to read it & ask God to reveal himself. They said they would.

Popular stand, young girl about 8 years old asked for houses for homeless people. Elderly lady asked for wisdom. People were even more interested and drawn to the stand when they realised it was linked to the church. People commented frequently that “it was a good idea”. Families and couples particularly drawn to it. Good show.

Lots of conversations. It was really easy to chat to people. One young man, happy to write on a star. Said he used to believe. But not now. One older man said he believed but only prayed when the car broke down etc.

I spoke to 3 female older teenagers. One had been brought up in the Bible belt in America. She believed something. I offered them a Luke’s Gospel and asked if they would read the first few pages this Christmas. They said they would.

I had a lovely chat to a young lady with 8 month old. She’d had post-natal depression. I suggested ‘Bumps & Babies’ or a toddler group. She said church groups were very inclusive & said she’d give it a go.

Lots of visitors showing interest and many conversations about Jesus. Many more stars added to the sky. Prayer for a lady who said she was a Druid. As she came to the chalet she was visibly overcome by the Holy Spirit. It was a great honour to pray for her. Even dogs came to visit us - a good opener to conversation!

On a wet, windy day we only had 15-20 stars. Most people took one look and saw we had nothing to sell then moved on. Others looked closer and asked how much it cost to have a star! Many friendly conversations, but none about faith. We will pass on thoughts about the siting of the chalet, and identification of Churches Together in Winchester, separately.

1st hour still very wet and windy with only a handful of people braving the elements. 2nd hour drier; students & youngsters with parents after school. Nativity was a good draw. Stars won’t stick - too wet! Agree about the siting - especially today.

[a] long conversation with a retired police officer; answered useful questions from a group of 4 teenagers; prayed with a Christian worker who’s lost her glasses; decided not to suggest writing on stars - too wet & windy, but, mercifully, warm.

Wet & quiet - tried to tidy up stars strewn over ground; posters sodden.

Very quiet, at least stopped raining for a bit. Friendly chats to stall holders. Went early as nothing happening.

Doors had blown off the chalet today and so shifts had been cancelled - but I came anyway as had a strong calling from God to come to minister to the other chalet holders with free tea & coffees.
I took trays round, 4 at a time, of teas and coffees & it was a great opener to the vendors for conversation.
I think I gave out about 30 drinks & had conversations with about 90% of those people. I offered prayer to everyone I spoke to & about 90% of people said yes please.
I prayed for stalls, business, weather, family, Christmas, vendors’ children, ill relatives etc. I wore a Christ Church prayer ministry badge.
Reaction to free drinks was people were surprised & said what a lovely thing. They were often very touched - particularly when I asked if there was anything I could pray about, for them. When they said yes to this, I prayed quickly on the spot after asking their name. People often a little tearful after I prayed these short prayers & touched that drinks were free - no strings attached! Would recommend!!

Lots of good conversations & engagement with the nativity. Chatting about church and whether people go at Christmas. Good to engage with people!

Companion not well, so - a solo stint. Fine clear weather; doors repaired. A long talk with an elderly man; another with an elderly couple, then 3 with young couples, 1 with father & son, 1 with a lone woman, and short exchanges with several others. Gave away - mainly - Luke, J. John’s booklet and Knowing God Personally. Also used the questionnaire (v. helpful).

A great day full of joy. Many conversations and lots of photographs taken - both in the Nativity and of the stars. People appreciated the Christian presence and the opportunity for a chat. Good conversations with people of different faiths, Christians and those who were exploring or curious. People were happy to talk about what Christmas means for them and happy to be prayed for. Several people took booklets and asked about local services. A lovely opportunity to witness to light and love and Jesus.

Lovely conversations, we did pick up a few stars to use (even though new ones are arriding Wednesday). One man asked if we had a gospel to give to his friend!

Please pray for B ongoing IVF treatment over the next two weeks. Pray that they are blessed with the child they so deeply want.

I invited a young man to write on a start. He joined in. I asked if he had a faith of his own. He said ‘not anymore’. He is a police officer and said he sees the best and the worst of human nature, and it affects his faith. I offered him a Luke’s gospel saying it had the story of Jesus’ birth and asked if he would read it. ‘Yes’ he said. He had a 2 month old daughter & said he wanted her to have the opportunity to have faith herself.

A lady was very thoughtful & I invited her. He wanted to, then started to be overcome. She said she’d passe a stall with stars on & now this. Her daughter died 4 years ago but she is often more overcome now. A star had been named after her!

Many conversations around nativity. One said, I’m not religious but I do think the baby Jesus belongs at the heart of Christmas. It’s not about presents.

A young lady visited and made stars for her niece and herself. She explained that there had been major family difficulties, but she had started going to Christ Church (and played [...] in the music group) and she had regained her confidence. She led a family reconciliation and the parents and their 4 children (and families) all live around Winchester.

A steady stream of star-makers, without much conversation about Christmas or Jesus. All in good spirits.

Noone at 12:30 when we arrived to do out stint. We sang some carols. Many folk with problems. Lady on a stall we spoke to, has lung cancer so we prayer for her. Lots of people have mentioned that they would have loved to have seen the “real Nativity” with dressing up clothes like previous years! Something to reinstate!

What a delight to end the day - the Cathedral Junior Choir singing carols and the Blessing of the Nativity Chalet. The chalet traders joined in the singing along with passers by. Also the young child who was besotted with elves stayed and joined in with the short service.

Spoke to a gentleman called M whose wife died aged 49 and has missed seeing her daughter & grandchildren grow up - M didn’t want prayer here at the chalet but put up a star giving thanks for family.

Talk[ed] to the man on [a particular] stall. I don’t know his name - sorry I never asked - but I spent 20 minutes talking to him. He definitely believes as he can’t fathom there not being a creator God of our wonderful world. He doesn’t follow any organised faith but he believes there’s more to life than the everyday. He’s worked abroad [with various charities], and has been married for 18 years to a [lady for a particular nationality]. Pray for him.

Man from Glastonbury said that the Nativity was the best he had seen in a while.

We prayed for E, who has a terrible pain in her back & the doctors don’t know what is wrong. She is a Christian from London.

Just to say there was a lady passed by who was going to be alone Christmas Day - would it be possible in future to have info on where she could go to be with people that day? I had seen [it] somewhere but couldn’t recall it.

Prayed for T’s friend J who is very dear to her and poorly.

Prayed for some people recently bereaved. Several conversations about past “Christian” experience.

Lunch time - couple of gospels given out.

Prayed with G & J - J recently gave his life to Christ after God answer his prayer (over a heart condition / suicidal thoughts). G exploring faith - she is divorced due to an abusive partner and I was able to assure her the divorce was not the unforgivable sin. We prayed for them and for their baby (G is pregnant). Very encouraging!

Prayed for a lady whose brother was diagnosed with cancer and he’s been given 4 months to live. He is in California, so it’s tough for her.

Prayed for C for her health.

Man from Dorset [...] with cancer - [prayed for] healing. C with cancer from Bournemouth - to be clear completely. J with cystic fibrosis - healing.

Cold and wet - need more stars - photos in stable popular!

It was so good to have lots of tracts to give out; I’d have been a bit lost otherwise.

Many people filled in stars - some bereavements, some hoping for less Brexit!
