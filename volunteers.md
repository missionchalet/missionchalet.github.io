If you would like to volunteer at this year's Mission Chalet, please note:

* It's best to plan to come to the training, otherwise you won't necessarily understand the theme.
* Please read _and abide by_ the Cathedral's [evangelism code](https://www.winchester-cathedral.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Code-of-Evangelism-Winchester-Cathedral-2018.pdf).
* Sign-up online later in the year.
* Read the [stories](stories-2018.md) from last year and be encouraged.
* You can be yourself and trust God to help you.
* Pray for many people to volunteer this year and for all the members of the public they will encounter.
