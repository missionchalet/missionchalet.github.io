Here are some more anonymised entries from the log book in 2018.

I met a lovely lady who wanted more peace of mind in her life.

One lady had lost her daughter this year and was happy to be prayed for.

A long discussion with an Anglo-Catholic gentleman.

Lots of university students. About 56 stars.

Please pray for R to make up with her Mum.

Please pray for S that his bone marrow treatment works.

Please pray for K, E and M (three separate). Leaflets out plus prayer points - a good session: PTL.

Lots of interested children. And photos.

Please pray for G.

Pray for L who is very poorly. Serious condition. Had 54 operations. & for her family.

A man said “I came last year (from Wigan) and wrote out a prayer. I came later on the early part of the following year and visited Vineyard Church -- and they read out my prayer! The one I had written! I was gobsmacked! Not only that, but my prayer was then answered when I got back to Wigan!”

Please pray that A’s baby will be granted life and health. Docs say less than 1% chance she will be born alive. Nevertheless, not our will but Yours. Thank you.

A lady walked away reading M’s words. [two ladies] having a first baby when dad has gone. Numerous students. 3 lively babies & mums.

Happy Birthday Jesus ♥

Thank you for looking after [A] like I wrote last year! She’s in a good place now! Love C.

I wish for [C’s] IVF to go well so she can have a child.

Popular stand, young girl about 8 years old asked for houses for homeless people. Elderly lady asked for wisdom. People were even more interested and drawn to the stand when they realised it was linked to the church. People commented frequently that “it was a good idea”. Families and couples particularly drawn to it. Good show.

Lots of conversations. It was really easy to chat to people. One young man, happy to write on a star. Said he used to believe. But not now. One older man said he believed but only prayed when the car broke down etc.

I spoke to 3 female older teenagers. One had been brought up in the Bible belt in America. She believed something. I offered them a Luke’s Gospel and asked if they would read the first few pages this Christmas. They said they would.

I had a lovely chat to a young lady with 8 month old. She’d had post-natal depression. I suggested ‘Bumps & Babies’ or a toddler group. She said church groups were very inclusive & said she’d give it a go.

Lots of visitors showing interest and many conversations about Jesus. Many more stars added to the sky. Prayer for a lady who said she was a Druid. As she came to the chalet she was visibly overcome by the Holy Spirit. It was a great honour to pray for her. Even dogs came to visit us - a good opener to conversation!

On a wet, windy day we only had 15-20 stars. Most people took one look and saw we had nothing to sell then moved on. Others looked closer and asked how much it cost to have a star! Many friendly conversations, but none about faith. We will pass on thoughts about the siting of the chalet, and identification of Churches Together in Winchester, separately.

1st hour still very wet and windy with only a handful of people braving the elements. 2nd hour drier; students & youngsters with parents after school. Nativity was a good draw. Stars won’t stick - too wet! Agree about the siting - especially today.

Wet & quiet - tried to tidy up stars strewn over ground; posters sodden.

Doors had blown off the chalet today and so shifts had been cancelled - but I came anyway as had a strong calling from God to come to minister to the other chalet holders with free tea & coffees.
I took trays round, 4 at a time, of teas and coffees & it was a great opener to the vendors for conversation.
I think I gave out about 30 drinks & had conversations with about 90% of those people. I offered prayer to everyone I spoke to & about 90% of people said yes please.
I prayed for stalls, business, weather, family, Christmas, vendors’ children, ill relatives etc. I wore a Christ Church prayer ministry badge.
Reaction to free drinks was people were surprised & said what a lovely thing. They were often very touched - particularly when I asked if there was anything I could pray about, for them. When they said yes to this, I prayed quickly on the spot after asking their name. People often a little tearful after I prayed these short prayers & touched that drinks were free - no strings attached! Would recommend!!

Lots of good conversations & engagement with the nativity. Chatting about church and whether people go at Christmas. Good to engage with people!

Companion not well, so - a solo stint. Fine clear weather; doors repaired. A long talk with an elderly man; another with an elderly couple, then 3 with young couples, 1 with father & son, 1 with a lone woman, and short exchanges with several others. Gave away - mainly - Luke, J. John’s booklet and Knowing God Personally. Also used the questionnaire (v. helpful).

Lovely conversations, we did pick up a few stars to use (even though new ones are arriding Wednesday). One man asked if we had a gospel to give to his friend!

Please pray for B ongoing IVF treatment over the next two weeks. Pray that they are blessed with the child they so deeply want.

I invited a young man to write on a star. He joined in. I asked if he had a faith of his own. He said ‘not anymore’. He is a police officer and said he sees the best and the worst of human nature, and it affects his faith. I offered him a Luke’s gospel saying it had the story of Jesus’ birth and asked if he would read it. ‘Yes’ he said. He had a 2 month old daughter & said he wanted her to have the opportunity to have faith herself.

A lady was very thoughtful & I invited her. He wanted to, then started to be overcome. She said she’d passe a stall with stars on & now this. Her daughter died 4 years ago but she is often more overcome now. A star had been named after her!

Many conversations around nativity. One said, I’m not religious but I do think the baby Jesus belongs at the heart of Christmas. It’s not about presents.

A young lady visited and made stars for her niece and herself. She explained that there had been major family difficulties, but she had started going to Christ Church (and played [...] in the music group) and she had regained her confidence. She led a family reconciliation and the parents and their 4 children (and families) all live around Winchester.

Spoke to a gentleman called M whose wife died aged 49 and has missed seeing her daughter & grandchildren grow up - M didn’t want prayer here at the chalet but put up a star giving thanks for family.

Talk[ed] to the man on [a particular] stall. I don’t know his name - sorry I never asked - but I spent 20 minutes talking to him. He definitely believes as he can’t fathom there not being a creator God of our wonderful world. He doesn’t follow any organised faith but he believes there’s more to life than the everyday. He’s worked abroad [with various charities], and has been married for 18 years to a [lady for a particular nationality]. Pray for him.

Man from Glastonbury said that the Nativity was the best he had seen in a while.

Cold and wet - need more stars - photos in stable popular!

We prayed for E, who has a terrible pain in her back & the doctors don’t know what is wrong. She is a Christian from London.

Just to say there was a lady passed by who was going to be alone Christmas Day - would it be possible in future to have info on where she could go to be with people that day? I had seen [it] somewhere but couldn’t recall it.

Prayed for T’s friend J who is very dear to her and poorly.

Prayed for some people recently bereaved. Several conversations about past “Christian” experience.

Prayed with G & J - J recently gave his life to Christ after God answer his prayer (over a heart condition / suicidal thoughts). G exploring faith - she is divorced due to an abusive partner and I was able to assure her the divorce was not the unforgivable sin. We prayed for them and for their baby (G is pregnant). Very encouraging!

Prayed for a lady whose brother was diagnosed with cancer and he’s been given 4 months to live. He is in California, so it’s tough for her.

Prayed for C for her health.

It was so good to have lots of tracts to give out; I’d have been a bit lost otherwise.

Many people filled in stars - some bereavements, some hoping for less Brexit!
